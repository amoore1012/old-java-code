# old-java-code
This most of the Java code from my high school senior year Online Java Class
also the link wecancodeit.org/zaudreys-copy-of-corporate-training-page/ leads to a website that I made for a company that I interned for the summer after my senior year.  It is their corporate training page, but I made this as my personal copy so that if anyone makes changes that isn't my work, it won't be included
That summer (2017) I also made these webpages that may no longer exist...
